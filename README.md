I created this travel planning app to help simplify the otherwise overwhelming process of planning family vacations. All you have to do is pick a location, select dates, and let the app take care of everything else.

Once you have selected from our suggested list of landmarks and attractions, the app will generate a personalized itinerary and packing list for you. You can focus on enjoying your trip, while the app takes care of the rest!
